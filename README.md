Project Description: Recipe Web App

This Recipe Web App allows users to easily manage and search their favorite recipes. Users can add new recipes by providing a name, ingredients, and method, along with an optional image. The app features a user-friendly interface that enables searching and filtering recipes based on ingredients or names.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the web pages and content.
CSS: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity, handling form submissions, and managing recipe data.
Local Storage: To save recipes in the browser, allowing users to access their saved recipes even after refreshing the page.

This project is a great way to learn about web development and how to create a functional application using these core web technologies.
